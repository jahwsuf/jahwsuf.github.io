* Setting Up Base
* An Eye Toward Expansion

First off, don't be afraid to just dive into the game and try things out for a couple of games first.  There's a lot to take in, and a lot of the game's appeal is in exploration and discovery - both in terms of game mechanics and your dupes' world.  Oh, and "dupes"?  "Dupe" is shorthand for "Duplicant," the race of your adorable little crew members in this game.

If you wish to follow along with this guide, I'll be basing everything on a run using the world-gen seed `966355023`.  (Thanks to [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oxygennotincluded/comments/7me2lk/share_your_map_seeds_here/) for the seed.)  It has an extremely convenient setup for learning the game and works with the new Ranching upgrade.

# [](#assembling-your-crew)Assembling Your Crew

So, you just got this game and are wondering how to begin, or perhaps, *where* to begin.  What are your important decisions?  What goals should you have?  How should I approach the game?  All are good questions, so let's get to it with the first screen you'll see as you start a game.

Let's get the obvious things out of the way.  

* You get to start the game with three randomly-generated Duplicants.  As the game progresses, you'll get the opportunity to gain more of them, but at the start of the game you have a special opportunity - you can infinitely re-roll your generated Duplicants individually to custom-tailor your starting team.  Once the game proper begins, this ability is lost to you, so feel free to take some time looking for the ideal crew - you'll have to rely on favorable random-generation later!

* Each Dupe has a unique set of traits and interests.  While the other details can matter in the long run, if you manage your base well they should have little impact on your game until your run ends.

A few less-obvious things to note:

* The most important decision you have to make here are regarding your initial traits and stats.  The interests mostly serve as a buff to learning jobs - they're most useful when you _need_ a Dupe to skill up quickly to unlock a special skill, which is a situation you'll only reach after a number of cycles.

* Some stats are not particularly important until later in the game:
  * Tinkering - this affects manually-operated machines.  It'll take a while for this to become particularly relevant.
  * Creativity - this affects your ability to lower stress through base decor.  Artists are great, but all you need is a +4 to Creativity to make masterpiece paintings - fairly easily obtainable from a +2 Dupe after Job selection.  Those aren't terribly uncommon.
  * Ranching - this only becomes practical after you have established a sustainable farm, as it requires a second-tier job and a third-tier research to be of _any_ use.  It's definitely a nice skill, but it's useless when starting out.
  * Kindness - this matters when you start breaking into the Toxic (slime-filled) biome.

* If possible, I advise picking duplicants for the following roles, prioritized from most to least important:
  * A ["Researcher"](dupe-builds#researcher) - someone with a high learning stat and without Small Bladder.  You have to unlock everything interesting in ONI.
  * A ["Farmer"](dupe-builds#farmer) - someone who can efficiently manage your colony's food and plants.  Multiplying seeds is important.
  * A ["Pioneer"](dupe-builds#pioneer) (Miner/Architect) - a great digger who can clear out early space for your base.  All the better if they can construct well.
  * A ["Sweeper"](dupe-builds#sweeper) (Gofer/Groundskeeper) - a dupe who can efficiently shuttle around your colony's material resources.

* You may have noticed that I've listed more than three priorities above, despite you only being able to select three Dupes.  This is intentional, as your initial Dupes will need to put in double-duty by pitching in toward multiple types of tasks to most effectively manage your base.

Here are the dupes I'll be starting this tutorial with:
