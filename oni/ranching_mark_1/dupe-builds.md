# Dupe Traits

## Positives:
* You'll note that many of the traits simply boost a Dupe's starting skill level.  This is a boost past the maximum cap for the stat and directly modifies its base level.
* However, some skills exist with special unique bonuses - one skill allows a Duplicant to use less oxygen, another lowers their Decor requirement, one reduces a Dupe's susceptibility to disease, and another allows Dupes to move through water at standard speed.


## Negatives:
* Some negative skills simply disable jobs.  Personally, a few of these will likely be your best option.
  * Yokel blocks research, but you can only ever use a maximum of two researchers, and I highly recommend restricting yourself to just one.  
  * Cooking isn't high demand, so Gastrophobia's a perfectly fine negative.  
  * Scaredy-cat is fine in small numbers as well - even a single Dupe can take on a Hatch just fine.
* Problematic negatives:
  * There are ones that block digging and construction, which I do not recommend for your initial crew.
  * Loud Sleepers will need a cot separate from where other dupes might sleep - this can easily disrupt your base layout and cause issues with planning as you learn.  
  * Small Bladder seems innocuous, but that Dupe's going to need a lot more breaks and will likely be less useful - and their waste will take increase your overall workload a bit.
  * Flatulent disrupts any dupes whenever it triggers, which can disrupt their work.  It also easily messes with any gas management setup you may be going for.
  * Narcoleptic is a bad negative to take for any supply-oriented (high Athletic + Strength) dupe; they'll forget whatever item they were delivering when they take their nap.
